# Overview

Boil is a VSC extension that allows for users to create and manage custom boilerplates. The main idea is to record all the actions that a user would do when initalizing a project, setting up connections to external services like AWS or supabase or any repeated series of actions that could be automated for better consistency across one or multiple projects.

# Roadmap

Currently the project is only starting with a theory in mind and nothing concrete to plan around. Once the main idea has been confirmed, a clear roadmap will be drawn with a list of features to implement and issues that need to be covered.
